    <h1 style="color:red">HVAC Automation Systems</h1>
    <p>An HVAC system is heating ventilation and an Air conditioning system in a big area where usual air conditioners can't be used .It contains a boiler,chiller ,cooling tower and air handling unit.<br>
    This system is used to control the temperature of a designated space with control of moisture in the air ,supply of oxygen in the air with controlled gas level<br>
  It also helps in cross contamination of airborne the movement of air by regulating .A typical HVAC system consists of functionally or geographically distributed controllers that control several processes in a building or group of buildings either from a central host computer or through the Internet from a unit that connects the functions of the host computer and the webserver. HVAC equipment coming today has embedded controllers to smartly and remotely handle operations of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning of the building.</p>

  <h2> Working of hvac system </h2>
  <img src=./assets/images/hvac.jpg   alt="hvac system" height="350"  />
  <p> As shown in above diagram fresh air is supplied using treated fresh air .Returned air and treated fresh air are combined together in first chamber and send to pre filter ,after filteration from free filter it is send to Fine filter.<br>
  This air is filtered using blower,air moves forward to cooling coil as the suggests cooling coil is used for cooling air.Then this cool air is send to moisture eliminator which eliminates moisture in required amounts.<br>
 Heating coil is used to heat the air to particular required temperature.Then the air is passed through semi heppa filter.Then this air is supplied to rooms.<br>
These rooms have supply ducts ,hepa filter through which air enters clean room.Then this air needs to be continously purified so it is passed through prefilters to first chamber then the cycle repeats and rooms recieve purified air continously</p>

<h2>Electrical Components Required in Havoc Systems</h2>
<h3>Contactors </h3>

<p>This component will control electricity flow in AC systems 
  <br> one of its main functions is cutting off the power and supplying the power whenever needed
 .It can be controlled from longer distances.This is used in devices which require high power.<br>
</p>

<h3>Fan Motor </h3>
<p> This component moves air in and out .As fan runs it circulates air in and out.</p>
<hr/>
<h3> Thermostat</h3>
<p>It monitors indoor temperatures .when the temperature of thermostat falls below  a certain temperature,the thermostat contacts close which signals the contators to turn on the compressor.</p>

<h2> Sensors  used in HVAC system </h2>
<h3> Pressure sensor</h3>
<p> Pressure sensors monitor pressure levels within specific zones, and measure the pressure drop across filters and other devices, effectively alerting the system when maintenance and filter replacement is required. Accurate pressure measurement is vital for optimal HVAC system performance. Pressure sensors can measure extremely high and low pressures in air and water applications offering precise measurement of pressure, differential pressure, and velocity for reliable monitoring. Applications include VAV (variable air volume) control, static duct pressure, clogged HVAC filter detection, HVAC transmitters, and indoor air quality monitoring systems. Pressure sensors from Belimo offer eight field selectable pressure ranges in one unit. Excellent zero-point stability and high accuracy with an auto-zero function that manually calibration itself every ten minutes.
</p>
<h3>Temperature Sensor</h3>
<p>Temperature sensors measure air and water temperature and adjust the heating and air conditioning to raise or lower the air temperature based on the programmed setpoint preventing wasted energy. You can also use the sensors' data to learn about a room's airflow and air quality. Accurate and reliable temperature readings are essential for optimal building comfort and energy efficiency. </p>
